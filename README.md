Coding Challenges

In this repository I solve some interesting coding problems which mainly use data structures and algorithms.
For some of them I follow https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/


1. Diff tool: lets you compare two files and see the differences between them.
In its core, the algorithm I use, uses dynamic programming with memoization. This is a popular Leetcode problem called 'Longest Common Subsequence'.
I modify the basic algorithm to compare two lists of strings and then instead of finsing what is common between the given texts, I output the difference instead.
